# Cross-repository governance synchronization

## Baseline

- Current reference: `NESHANE-V3-GOV-P00-000A`.
- Scope: the Root `AGENTS.md`, Root engineering standards, and this synchronization policy.
- This reference is a governance revision label, not an ADR. It does not approve choices explicitly marked proposed or unresolved.
- No V3 ADR is currently present. A future ADR is authoritative only after it is explicitly approved and stored in the Root architecture area.

## Ownership

- Root owns cross-repository principles, ADRs, shared standards, and architecture review policy.
- Backend owns Java/Spring Boot implementation guidance and repository-local skills.
- Frontend owns framework-neutral frontend implementation guidance and repository-local skills.
- Backend and Frontend remain independent Git repositories. Do not use submodules, nested-repository tracking, or synchronization automation for this policy.

## Propagation process

1. Approve the architecture change in Root and update the affected Root standard or ADR.
2. Assign a new explicit governance baseline reference in this document.
3. Review impact on Backend and Frontend separately.
4. Update only affected local instructions, standards, and skills; record the new reference in each repository's `architecture/governance-baseline.md`.
5. Review local differences for consistency before implementation resumes. Propagation is complete only when each affected repository records the same current reference.

## Missing, stale, or conflicting guidance

- A repository remains usable without the Root checkout because its local baseline records the required invariants.
- If Root is available and the local reference differs, stop architecture-sensitive work and report the mismatch.
- If a required decision is absent, mark it unresolved and request approval; do not invent a replacement.
- If local guidance conflicts with an approved Root ADR or standard, the Root decision wins, but Codex must report the conflict and update local guidance only under an authorized Task ID.
- Do not describe a nonexistent or proposed document as approved.
